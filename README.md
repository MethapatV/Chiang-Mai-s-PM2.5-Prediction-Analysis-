# Chiang Mai's PM2.5 Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates air quality in Chiang Mai, Thailand, by predicting PM2.5 levels using historical weather data and machine learning techniques. PM2.5, a dangerous air pollutant, has impacted public health in Northern Thailand for nearly a decade. Using XGBoost and lag feature engineering, this project builds a predictive model to support environmental decision-making.
